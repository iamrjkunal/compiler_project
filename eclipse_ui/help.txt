#7# adding jar files

Description:
jar files are just like libraries.

solution:
copy *.jar file and paste it on the current project(on left panel) where u r working i.e. writing codes n all.

After pasting the jar file eclipse has to explicitly get aware of it so we have to do these for it:

 right click on project u r working>properties>java Build path>libraries>add jars and add the jar file u want.
